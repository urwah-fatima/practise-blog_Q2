      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        At its core, mindfulness meditation is about training your attention. Instead of letting your mind wander to the past or future, you gently guide it back to the present moment. This can involve focusing on your breath, noticing the sensations in your body, or simply observing your thoughts as they come and go. It's not about emptying your mind; it's about becoming more aware of its contents.
