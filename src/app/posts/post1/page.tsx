      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Quantum physics explores the behavior of matter and energy at the most fundamental levels. At this scale, the familiar laws of classical physics break down, and a bizarre, counterintuitive reality takes over. It's a world where particles can be in multiple places at once, where observation changes reality, and where the very fabric of the universe appears probabilistic. Intrigued? Let's dive into the fascinating world of quantum physics.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Beyond Our Everyday Experience:</h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        We're used to the world operating according to certain rules. An apple falls from a tree, a ball rolls when pushed – these are governed by classical physics, the physics of our everyday experience. But what happens when we zoom in, far beyond the apple and the ball, to the tiniest constituents of matter: atoms and the particles within them? That's where quantum physics comes into play, and the rules are dramatically different.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Key Concepts that Will Blow Your Mind:</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Quantization:</strong> Energy, like light, isn't continuous; it comes in discrete packets called quanta (or photons in the case of light). Think of it like stairs rather than a ramp – you can only be on specific steps, not in between.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wave-Particle Duality:</strong> Particles, like electrons, can behave like waves, and waves, like light, can behave like particles. This "duality" is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. Imagine something being both a ripple in water and a tiny marble at the same time!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Superposition:</strong> A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously. A famous thought experiment, Schrödinger's Cat, illustrates this with a cat that is both alive and dead until observed. While the cat analogy is a thought experiment, the underlying principle is real for subatomic particles.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Uncertainty Principle:</strong> There's a fundamental limit to how precisely we can know certain pairs of properties of a particle, like its position and momentum. The more accurately we know one, the less accurately we know the other. It's not about our measurement tools being imperfect; it's an inherent property of the universe.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Entanglement:</strong> Two or more particles can become linked in such a way that they share the same fate, no matter how far apart they are. Measuring the state of one instantly affects the state of the other, a phenomenon Einstein famously called "spooky action at a distance."
        </li>
      </ul>
